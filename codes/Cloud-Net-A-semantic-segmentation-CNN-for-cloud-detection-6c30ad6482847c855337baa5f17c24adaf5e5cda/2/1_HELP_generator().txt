explain each parameter of .generator()
The .generator() method is used in Keras to define a generator for training data. This method takes the following parameters:

inputs: The input data for the generator. This can be a numpy array or a sequence of numpy arrays.

outputs: The output data for the generator. This can be a numpy array or a sequence of numpy arrays.

batch_size: The number of samples to generate in each batch.

shuffle: A boolean indicating whether to shuffle the samples before generating the batches.

sampling_function: A function that defines how the samples should be generated. The function should take the inputs and outputs as arguments, and return a generator that yields the samples in batches.

seed: A seed for the random number generator used for shuffling and sample generation. This can be used to ensure reproducibility of the generated samples.

Note that the parameters and functionality of the .generator() method may vary depending on the specific implementation in use.
